# shitty-png-to-svg
so you know how the whole purpose of an svg is so you can scale it? i mean its literally in the name.  
yea, i fucked that up.  
this program takes a png file, and replaces every pixel with a 1 by 1 square, basically creating a pixel in a file format thats supposed to not have pixels.  
i know, very useful  
how to use:  
in a folder, put an empty html file called "output.html", put your png image and rename it to "input.png". run the py file, it should print "done" when its done, duh  
### warning: in my experience, pictures bigger than 200pixels cause lag on your browser when its trying to render it. do that at your own risk. im not responsible if your shit catches on fire
